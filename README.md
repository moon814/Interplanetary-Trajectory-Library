# Interplanetary-Trajectory-Library
This repo contains multiple algorithms and tools to target an orbit around a planet of choice.

The current setup uses only resonant orbits to target an orbit around Neptune and utilizes a simple brute-force search algorithm to target B-plane parameters or Flyby parameters. The parameter selection was within a range provided by class materials. 

Later, will implement MATLAB tools such as optimal functions to find optimal B-plane paramters. 
Later, will implement other flyby methods to target trajectory around Neptune or other plaent
Later, will use one of the Moons of target planet to slow down before entering the orbit of target planet.
